# Advanced-Embedded-Training
This repository documents my hands-on practice with advanced embedded and RTOS concepts commonly used in production firmware. It contains code snippets, small experiments, and notes covering topics such as DMA, RTOS tasks/threads, mutexes, semaphores, queues, interrupts, and other concurrency and performance-critical mechanisms.
The focus is on building practical understanding of how these features behave in real systems and how they are typically used in complex embedded products such as drones, scan engines, robotics, and similar platforms.
